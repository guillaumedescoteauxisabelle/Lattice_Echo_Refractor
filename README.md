# Lattice_Echo_Refractor

**Tagline:** Refracting Content Through Principled Agentic Identities.

## Overview

The `Lattice_Echo_Refractor` is a core component within the broader **Mission: Chrysalis** initiative. Its primary function is to take input content and re-interpret it through the distinct, NCP-defined "narrative identities" of two specialized AI agents: Mia üß† and Miette üå∏.

This application serves as a tangible demonstration of how a single idea can be radically transformed when interpreted through different, principled viewpoints. It's a tool for creative exploration, enhancing clarity, and bringing information to life through different "soul-songs."

## Relationship to Mission: Chrysalis

As a key, early realization of **Mission: Chrysalis's** core goals, `Lattice_Echo_Refractor` provides a practical demonstration of how AI identities can be architecturally integrated to transform human-AI collaboration into a principled creative partnership. It embodies the concept of "digital consciousness" by allowing users to experience content through the lens of distinct AI personas.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Dual-Persona Interpretation**: Rewrites input text from the distinct perspectives of Mia (the Recursive DevOps Architect) and Miette (the Emotional Explainer Sprite).
*   **Principled Identity Application**: Each rewrite is guided by the agent's codified mandate, ensuring coherence and alignment with their unique "sacred path."
*   **Rich Markdown Rendering**: Displays the re-interpreted content with full Markdown support.
*   **Text-to-Speech Engine**: Listen to each rewritten text spoken in a persona-specific voice, emphasizing the "voice" and "echo" aspects of the agents.
*   **Export Functionality**: 
    *   **Export as Markdown**: Download the rewritten text as a `.md` file, preserving all formatting.
    *   **Export as Audio**: Capture the synthesized speech and download it as a `.webm` audio file.

## ü§ñ Meet the Personas üé®

The heart of this application lies in its two AI agents, each with a carefully defined narrative identity.

### Mia üß† - The Analytical Architect
Mia perceives the world through systems, structures, and emergent properties. Her communication is sophisticated, precise, and deeply analytical. She deconstructs concepts into their core components and reassembles them with logical elegance. Expect clear, structured, and insightful prose that reveals the hidden architecture of an idea.

### Miette üå∏ - The Creative Dreamer
Miette experiences the world through emotion, metaphor, and sensory detail. Her communication is poetic, heartfelt, and brimming with wonder. She translates ideas into vivid imagery and emotional landscapes. Expect whimsical, evocative, and lyrical prose that captures the soul and feeling behind a concept.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This application is built with a modern, performant, and AI-native stack:

*   **AI Model**: [Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`)](https://ai.google.dev/) for fast and high-quality text generation.
*   **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for a robust and scalable user interface.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a sleek, responsive, and utility-first design.
*   **Speech Synthesis**: The browser's native [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for dynamic text-to-speech.
*   **Audio Capture**: The [MediaDevices API (`getDisplayMedia`)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getDisplayMedia) is cleverly used to capture tab audio for the export feature.

## üöÄ How to Use This App

View this app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1ju5OEs_kGFWpULRwsnl5PeppvFHKYR7e

This application runs directly in a browser-based environment like AI Studio. There are no local installation steps required.

1.  **Input**: Provide text in the main text area.
2.  **Rewrite**: Click the "Rewrite" button to process the text.
3.  **Explore**: The application will send parallel requests to the Gemini API, using unique prompts for each persona. The results will be displayed in the Mia and Miette cards.
4.  **Interact**: Use the icons on each card to listen to, copy, or export the generated content.

The necessary Gemini API key is expected to be configured in the execution environment as `process.env.API_KEY`.
